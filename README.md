Pizza Palace Sales Data Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

**Problem Statement:**
To leverage machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to analyze and predict pizza sales at Pizza Palace, a synthetic pizza place in the US. By understanding the sales patterns and predicting future sales, Pizza Palace aims to optimize inventory, improve marketing strategies, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

**Description:**
A synthetic dataset that describes pizza sales for a pizza place somewhere in the US. While the contents are artificial, the ingredients used to make the pizzas are far from it. There are 32 different pizzas that fall into 4 different categories: classic (classic pizzas: 'You probably had one like it before, but never like this!'), chicken (pizzas with chicken as a major ingredient: 'Try the Southwest Chicken Pizza! You'll love it!'), supreme (pizzas that try a little harder: 'My Soppressata pizza uses only the finest salami from my personal salumist!'), and, veggie (pizzas without any meats whatsoever: 'My Five Cheese pizza has so many cheeses, I can only offer it in Large Size!').

**Conclusion:**
